# RANDOM COLOR GENERATOR IN NODE.JS

## Overview

This project is a Node.js application that generates randomly colored blocks in the console, along with a hexadecimal value in the middle of the block.

## Usage

To generate a color block, run the application with arguments for hue and luminosity (however, both are optional!):

> node index.js `<hue>` `<luminosity>`

- `<hue>`: (optional) The hue to use for the color.
- `<luminosity>`: (optional) The luminosity of the color. Can be 'bright', 'light', or 'dark'.

Example:

> node index.js red dark

This generates a a block with red hue and dark luminosity.
